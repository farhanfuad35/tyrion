# tyrion
Tyrion is a personal project made for my younger sister so she can easily call my family members. It's a very simple app made with React Native for learning purpose.

To run, pull the project and create a `.env` file containing the phone numbers and change the Config variables in App.js accordingly. For example, if the entries are like this:<br>
```
ALEX=01111111111
ZENDYA=01999999999
```

Then they can be accessed by `Config.ALEX` and `Config.ZENDYA` respectively.<br><br>

## Environment
Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Run Expo Server:
```
npm start
```
Follow the instructions on the terminal to run on your desired emulator.<br>
To download the .apk directly visit Expo server.
